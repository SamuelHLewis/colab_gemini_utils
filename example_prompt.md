# Gemini System Prompt

This notebook contains the code for an entire project. Each file in the codebase is represented by a pair of cells in this notebook: the filename is in a markdown cell, and the contents of that file is in the following code cell. When I refer to a file by name, I want you to use the contents of the corresponding code cell.

When providing feedback and editing code, follow these rules:

**Style**
* functions: always include type hinting

**Infrastructure**
* unit tests: always use pytest
